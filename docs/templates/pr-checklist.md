## PR Checklist for Authors

Include this checklist in PR descriptions or copy it into your PR body to help reviewers:

- [ ] I described the problem and the approach in the PR description
- [ ] Linked issues and acceptance criteria are included
- [ ] Tests added/updated (unit/integration) where applicable
- [ ] Linting and static analysis pass locally
- [ ] Changes are < 400 lines where possible or split into multiple PRs
- [ ] Any required migration or config changes documented
- [ ] All reviewers assigned and approvals requested

Notes:
- If a PR is large for technical reasons, add a short checklist for reviewers describing how to validate and which files to focus on.
